This project provides a simple example of using the distributed tracing client library (cloudtrace) that is part of [Apache Accumulo](http://accumulo.apache.org/). This example will hopefully get merged in with Accumulo's other examples. 

This example is being created in support of [ACCUMULO-1502](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-1502) to better document Accumuo's tracing capabilities.
